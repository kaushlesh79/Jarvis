# Basic AI Assistant

This is a beginner-friendly project: a Basic AI Assistant built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The assistant performs simple tasks and showcases essential web development skills.

## Features

2. **Simple Calculations**  
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

3. **Weather Simulation**  
   - Provide random weather predictions like "Sunny," "Rainy," or "Cloudy."

4. **Random Joke Generator**  
   - Share a random pre-set joke from a list to lighten up your day.

4. **Ask me about Weather **  
   - Can tell you about weather of different places.
